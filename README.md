# Investor Relations Management Tool

## Description

This is a tool I developed using VBA and Microsoft Excel to manage the main operative tasks of the investor relations office at the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Peru.

It has over 9k lines of code and it is fully automated. As such, it was a very helpful tool.

## Usage

Just open it, hit "Iniciar sesi√≥n".

In "Seleecione su usuario" just select "Administrador" and in password just write admin. That'd do it.

## Disclaimer

This project was developed solely by me. It is not intented to be published as such but it may be useful to someone in need of some of the features of this macro.

Use it at your own risk and only if you know what you're doing with VBA. This tool has 29 modules, 23 forms and 9k lines of code, so if you change something, you better know what you're doing.
